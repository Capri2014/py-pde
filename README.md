Python package for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). 
This package provides classes for scalar and tensor fields discretized on grids
as well as associated differential operators.
This allows defining, inspecting, and solving typical PDEs that appear for
instance in the study of dynamical systems in physics.
 

A detailed [documentation is available on readthedocs](https://py-pde.readthedocs.io/)
and as [a single PDF file](https://py-pde.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/latest/pdf/).
